# Logic Code Practice

This repository is a collection of all exercises that I did on my own, I go on geek for geek or other sites that have these practices and 
use it for practice, my goal is to complete them on my own. Maybe search up a syntax or two but to hack the logic on my own is a must.

I will be commenting out as I go when completing the problems. Will be using this also as a log sheet for my up coming development skills in programming.
